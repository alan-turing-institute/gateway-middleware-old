Simulation Description
-----------------------

This is a LES simulation of stratified air-water flow in a horizontal channel of rectangular cross-section. The channel length, width and height are 2m x 0.2m x 0.1m respectively. Periodic boundary conditions have been imposed in the stream-wise direction. Regular wavy flow pattern is observed. Systematic measurments of the components of the mean velocity are performed to identify secondary flows in the transverse direction.
